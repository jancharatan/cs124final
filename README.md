# Description

For our final project in CS124: User Interfaces and Experiences at Pomona College, we were tasked with taking a company from the YC W22 batch and designing a website for that company. This repository contains a React site that is the implementation of our final design for Circular, a Singapore-based company that offers technology rentals.
